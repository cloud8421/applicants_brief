# Message poster

Write a library that posts text messages to different services. The library must be configurable to write single messages to:

* 1). The file system
* 2). A simple REST service at [http://nb-data-store.heroku.com/](http://nb-data-store.heroku.com/)
* 3). A Twitter account at twitter.com/nbtest (nbtest1/nbtest) [https://dev.twitter.com/apps/1128588/show](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/1128588/show)
* 4). All of the above at once

Posted messages must return a identifier so they can be retrieved later (but retrieving is not part of this brief)

## USE CASE EXAMPLE

Use this library in a Rails app, to be configured from user settings to write to their preferred service
